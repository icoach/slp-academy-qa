<p>What you need to learn first
What is a domain?
Domain is a unique adress on the internet, thanks to which anyone can find your website. When creating a website, domain is automatically generated in the format of domain.solidpixels.com. You can connect the website with your own domain, for example your-domain.com.
Each domain has its own administrator, called a registrar. This is important information for you because you change your domain settings through your registrar.
Domain is just the adress of your website. It is not hosting, the place where the website is stored. In solidpixels, we take care of the hosting for you and this service is part of the license.
Where is your domain registered?
If you don't know, where is your domain registered, you can find the registrar using the Whois search engine.
How to link the website to your domainIs your website registered with Forpsi, Wedos, Domény.cz or active24? Use the guides of the specific registrar: Forpsi, Wedos, Domény.cz and Active24. If your domain is registered somewhere else, use the general guide.1. Log in to the domain registrar administration. Select the domain you want to link to the solidpixels website.2. Find the option to change or edit DNS records and link the domain to our server. Edit the values according to the table shown below and wait for the changes to appear.OPTION 1TypeHostnameTTLValueAyourdomain.com3600185.59.208.137CNAMEwww.yourdomain.com3600yourdomain.comOPTION 2TypeHostnameTTLValueAyourdomain.com3600185.59.208.137Awww.yourdomain.com3600185.59.208.137If you are using AAAA records, it is also required to fill out the IPv6 address:TypeHostnameTTLValueAAAAyourdomain.com36002a00:1ed0:80::20</p>
<p>Change of DNS records won't take effect immediately
The wait time depends on the TTL value of the original record. TTL determines the length of time the servers remember a DNS record in seconds. It corresponds to the time you will have to wait for the changes to appear.
If you want to speed up the change of DNS records, you can shorten TTL in advance so that the next change appears faster. After the final edit, switch TTL back to the longer time period. Short TTL needlessly increases the server load and slows down access for the visitors of the website.
Before linking to the solidpixels CMS, we recommend you first check, if the registrar has already processed the changes (registrar values can differ from the real values during the same time). You can check these values by searching the domain in the Who.is database, in the DNS tab.
If the DNS values aren't set up properly, the connection won't be succesful.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to the solidpixels administration and set up the new domain.
To change the domain, open the Settings tab, click the Website domain field and fill out the new domain. The format of the entered domain has to be www.yourdomain.com.
Solidpixels will check the correct settings of the DNS records and it will finish the linking of the domain with your website.</li>
