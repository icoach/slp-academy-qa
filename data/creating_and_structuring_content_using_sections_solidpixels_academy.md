Sharing sections across pages</p>
<p>Sections combine thematically identical blocks of content into a larger whole. This will allow you to work effectively with content, share content between pages, use background videos or animated effects.
Creating a new section
When you drag the first block onto a page, a section is automatically created around it. To create a new section:</p>
<p>select the block with which you want to start a new section,
drag it to the horizontal line labeled Insert section, which will appear below the last block of the previous section.</p>
<p>Copying sections
Like blocks, you can copy sections within a page:</p>
<p>hold down the Ctrl key (for Mac ⌘),
drag to copy section to next location.</p>
<p>Section settings
Use the gear icon to open the section settings:</p>
<p>move the cursor to the section,
the controls for the section are displayed,
click the gear icon next to the section name,
in the section settings you can change:</p>
<p>section background color,
a background image or video for which you can set effects such as parallax, blur or color filter, or a placeholder color or a palceholder image for video
section height and vertical alignment of the content,
color variant of the text - inverse or default.</p>
<p>Deleting sections
To delete a section:</p>
<p>move the cursor to the section,
the controls for the section are displayed,
in the upper right corner of the section, a trash can icon will appear,
by clicking the trash can icon, you will delete the section.</p>
<p>Content creation using sections
The basic building blocks of a site are blocks. However, the content can also be composed using entire sections. Thanks to this, you will get inspiration and save time on assembling blocks. You can work with three types of sections:</p>
<p>section templates from the library, to which we add newly designed section templates from various categories,
your own templates - user sections,
shared sections that you can use to share content across pages.</p>
<p>You insert them into the page using the drag &amp; drop editor. This means dragging the selected section from the menu to the page space just as you would for blocks.
Inserting a section template into a page
When you insert the first block into the page space, a section is created around it.
To create another section in the page:</p>
<p>go to a specific page,
in the switch in the top left corner, select Sections,
a library of sections will open up, including those you have created yourself,
select the section that suits your needs and drag it to the page.</p>
<p>After adding a section to the page, you can edit individual blocks and adapt the section to your needs.</p>
<p>Saving your own templates
If you want to save the section as a template:</p>
<p>go to settings (see section settings above),
select the option to save the section and select Template as the type.</p>
<p>The sections are saved to user sections. If you want to insert it into a page, proceed in the same way as when inserting section templates from the library.
* User sections are paid features that are not part of all plans. If you want to use the section, contact our support and we will find a solution.
Sharing sections across pages
You can set sections that appear in multiple places on the website as shared. This allows you to edit content from one place. Changes are overwritten to all places where the section is used.</p>
<p>after moving the cursor over the section, the controls for the section are displayed,
click the gear icon next to the section name,
select the option to save the section,
select shared as the type.</p>
<p>The section is saved to user sections. If you want to insert it into a page, proceed in the same way as when inserting section templates from the library.
Working with shared sections
You can identify shared sections by the Shared Section label that appears on the controls when you hover over the section.</p>
<p>To edit a shared section, double-click anywhere in the section. Then you edit the section using individual blocks as you are used to. After saving, the edits appear everywhere the section is used.
You can disconnect shared sections at any time:</p>
<p>hover over the section,
the controls for the section are displayed,
click the icon for disconnecting the shared section.</p>
