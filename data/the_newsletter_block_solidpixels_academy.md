<p>The Newsletter Block allows you to collect email addresses of visitors who are interested in subscribing to the newsletter about your service or product. Newsletter works in a similar way to The Form Block.</p>
<p>How to add a newsletter
After dragging The Newsletter Block on the page, you can open the settings by clicking its centre. The default newsletter contains only the email field.
Other blocks, which will allow you to get additional information, can be added to the newsletter. More detailed description of additional blocks can be found in the article about The Form Block.
Newsletter settings
The newsletter settings can be opened using the blue “Settings” button, which will appear after clicking the centre of the block.</p>
<p>In the upper part of the setting tab, you can change the name of the newsletter. You can toggle on the option of sending an email to both the administrator and the sender of the form.
After sending the form, either your own text can appear or you can redirect the visitor to a different page on the website.</p>
<p>Newsletter appearance
When it comes to the appearance of the newsletter, you can toggle on the option to display a style with a background, which can be adjusted in the Design tab.
There is also an option to remove spaces on the sides of the fields in the form.</p>
<p>Export settings
In the Exports tab, you can choose, to which services will the collected information be sent to.</p>
<p>Advanced
