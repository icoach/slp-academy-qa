In order to make the most effective use of your headline, it should be concise and to the point, and it should also attract the attention of your visitors. For example, you can use questions, prompts or surprising statements to attract visitors' attention and gain their interest in your texts.4.

Supplement the text with images or videos that will be interesting for your audience and increase the attractiveness of your content.If you want to increase the appeal of your content while engaging your audience, you can include images or videos in your text.

By adding images or videos to your texts, you will increase their attractiveness and also help your readers to better understand the content of your website.You have just read an article generated by ChatGTP by OpenAI. How did you find it? Did you learn anything new from it? If you are interested in our insights gathered during the creation of the article, read further.Behind the scenes or how it all happenedOur original intention was to test whether AI could help us generate quality content in record time. And we wanted to do it in an hour. We started by brainstorming topics, then had OpenAI generate an outline of the article. However, while generating the actual text, we ran into issues such as length, repetitiveness and tediousness, so we tried to adjust the prompt so that the result matched our expectations. In the end, we halved the originally planned text and arrived at a usable result after about an hour and a half.Is it worth it?You already know the result of our little experiment, as well as the story of its creation. But what are our thoughts and conclusions? What do we think about AI-powered content generation? In our opinion, content creators and copywriters don't have to worry about their jobs (yet). While an article generated using AI alone is formally and factually correct, it comes across as too generic and neutral, and unless you radically tame the length of the output, you'll end up with some really good bedtime reading material.We learned fairly quickly that we needed to submit articles one at a time, on specific, focused sub-questions, and also describe the style in which we wanted the resulting article. Certainly, the broader the topic entered, the more generic and general the result. In addition to the precision of the assignment, the language in which you specify the requirements has an impact on the final text. OpenAI was created using sources in English, and if a query is given in Czech, it translates both the initial question and the final answer, so the result may look wonky.Neutral and correct opinions are trendy, but interesting content provokes discussion and is meant to engage and stand out from the crowd. AI is very cautious with advice of any kind, nor can we automatically ask for any kind of content or formal invention, breathtaking vocabulary, concrete data or relevant examples from practice. On the other hand, it can be very useful for initial brainstorming, generating the outline and structure of upcoming texts, or coming up with alternative descriptions. We are definitely going to use it in these disciplines in the future.Wondering how professionals will deal with the same task? Stay tuned!
