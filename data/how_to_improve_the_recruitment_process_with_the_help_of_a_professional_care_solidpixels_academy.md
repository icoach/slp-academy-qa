<p>How to make a career website
The devil is in the details
It's all different than what you're used to.
Before you start</p>
<p>Recruiting new employees is one of the most expensive processes that companies go through on a regular basis. How to make the recruitment process as smooth and efficient as possible? On the road to the ideal employee, the key is to target the recruitment campaign correctly, attract the right candidates, provide sufficient information and save time by setting up automation of sub-processes. For this, a functional career website is essential. How to do it?
How to make a career website
Gone are the days when all you needed to recruit new employees was a page with a brief description of the vacancy and contact details for the HR department. Today's companies are going much further and striving to provide candidates with the best and most interactive web experience possible, offering the widest range of information that may be of interest to them and through which they can introduce themselves. Therefore, there are a few basic things to keep in mind when creating your current career website:</p>
<p>Present each job offer well. Start with the most important one. Who are you looking for? What kind of job? What do you want from them? What are you offering in return?</p>
<p>Let your employees speak for themselves. Every company is made up of people. And everyone wants to know who their potential future colleague is and what they think of their employer. Introduce your team and share their experience with potential candidates.</p>
<p>Say how you want to change the world. The most loyal employees are always motivated by how their values align with those of the company. Tell them why you do what you do. Share your philosophy.
Show your icing on the cake. Company benefits can be big draws. What all do you do to make your employees' lives more enjoyable?</p>
<p>Describe who you're looking for. What do you think your dream employee should look like for a long-term working relationship?
Show us what's going on in your company. Candidates want to know what's going on in your company. Show off your blog and social media or show off past or upcoming events.</p>
<p>Tell the candidates what to expect. Familiarise candidates with the steps of the recruitment process. What's waiting for them when they fill out the form on your website?
Make it easy to get in touch. Don't discourage candidates with a complicated contact process. Create a form on your website that they can use to send you all the required information and files.</p>
<p>Don't make yourself unnecessary work. Leave what you can to automation. Storing candidate data in clear spreadsheets, linking it to recruitment tools or automated confirmation emails will save you a lot of time.</p>
<p>Tip: What is automation and how can it help you?</p>
<p>Think of the future. You're not looking for anyone at the moment? Don't miss out on potential great employees and allow them to send in CVs even when you don't have any open positions. You never know when they'll come in handy.</p>

The devil is in the details
Perfect the user experience of your career website. An intuitive navigation structure, quality and concise yet rich content, and modern minimalist design are a given, but don't forget the (seemingly) little details that will take your recruitment process into the third millennium and help you reach the younger generations (Y, Z, etc.) who will soon make up the bulk of the global workforce.</p>
<p>A good contemporary recruitment website should be responsive, i.e. ready for all types of devices on which candidates will be displayed.
Don't forget to connect with social media. 79% of job seekers today are looking for information about their potential employer on social media. Among those who are in the first decade of their working lives, it's as high as 86%.
Link your recruiting website to your recruiting tools to save a ton of time and increase your chances of successfully landing a new employee. For example, try tools like Teamio to tidy up your recruitment process and help you communicate with candidates automatically.
Don't forget to update the content of your career site regularly. No one wants to read information that is no longer valid. If you can set up automatic updates for certain parts of your website, definitely do so - this can apply to new blog articles or posts on your social media channels.
Don't underestimate the loading speed of your career site. 57% of users leave a site that takes longer than 3 seconds to load, and 80% of them never return. Site load speed is not just about the visitor experience, it has a direct impact on conversion rates. Don't miss out on quality employees because of a slow website.</p>
<p>Tip: Why are websites built on solidpixels among the top 5% fastest websites on the internet?</p>
<p>Make sure your career website is visually appealing and interactive. A picture may be worth a thousand words, but video content works wonders and is sure to grab the attention of visitors.</p>
<p>It's all different than what you're used to.
Today's companies often go the route of a separate career site that is not part of their basic general site. Whether they choose this way depends mainly on the sphere in which they do their business. For example, large corporate firms in the financial sector want to appear serious to potential clients, but they would like to show a human face to their future employees. If they build their career website separately, they can get creative with it and make it more attractive to candidates, which they could not afford to do on their serious general website. This way, potential job seekers are also not put off by their staid corporate communication. There is simply a big difference between language for clients and language for employees, and this way companies can communicate to each of these groups separately.
A good example of this strategy is SKODA's recruitment website, whose tonality of communication is noticeably more informal from what you would find on the main company website.</p>
<p>A big current trend is also landing pages created specifically for a particular position that companies want to fill. These are usually important senior positions for which candidates are difficult to find, so it pays for companies to have a good recruitment campaign that leads candidates to a tailored website.

Before you start
Before you start creating your career website, be sure to prepare a few basic documents:</p>
<p>Visual Identity Manual - This includes all the components of your company's visual identity - logo, colors, fonts, usage, etc.
Structure - Plan out how your website will be structured, what its pages will look like, what sections they will have and what you want to populate them with. The basic sections in this case are About Us, Benefits, Team, Contacts or Forms.</p>
<p>Texts - What do you want to tell potential employees on your career website? Write all the necessary texts according to the planned structure - introduction of job offers, benefits, company philosophy...</p>
<p>Graphics, photos, videos - Visual content is key. Complete your website with photos of employees, pictograms of benefits, videos of company events, etc.</p>
<p>Existing content - What other content can you show candidates? Prepare articles from your blog or perhaps links to your social media.</p>
