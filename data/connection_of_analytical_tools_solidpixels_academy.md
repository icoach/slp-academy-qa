Adding Google Analytics tracking ID
To link Google Analytics 3 (Universal Analytics version) directly to the website, fill in the tracking ID in the website administration:</p>
<p>In the main navigation, select Settings and then Website Settings,
in the Analytical Tools section, fill in the tracking ID from your GA profile.</p>
<p>You can find the tracking ID in your Google Analytics account:</p>
<p>Click Admin,
select an account from the menu in the ACCOUNT column,
select a property from the menu in the PROPERTY column,
under PROPERTY, click Tracking Info &gt; Tracking Code. Your Tracking ID is displayed at the top of the page,
the tracking ID is in the format UA-XXXXXX-X.</p>
<p>For more information follow the Google documentation.</p>
<p>Adding Google Analytics 4 Tracking ID
The new version of Google Analytics 4 requires the use of a different measurement code and comes with a completely new interface and measurement logic. We do not recommend a complete transition to this version yet.
If you want to start collecting data in the new version of Google Analytics 4, we recommend running it in parallel with the previous version of Google Analytics.</p>
<p>Connect Universal Analytics using the previous part of this article
For Google Analytics 4, create a new account, which you can enter using Google Tag Manager.</p>
<p>Tip: Data collection using Analytics is related to the setting of the cookie bar
If the use of analytic cookies is disabled in the cookie bar, the site will stop sending data to Analytics.
Ownership verification for the Google Search Console
The easiest way to verify your ownership of the Google Search Console data access site is using the verification code:</p>
<p>In the main navigation, select Settings and then Website Settings,
in the Analytical Tools section, fill in the verification code generated in the Search Console.</p>
<p>The verification code is part of the HTML tag, to obtain it:</p>
<p>In the Search Console, select the HTML tag authentication option,
copy the verification code, which is usually a combination of 43 letters and numbers.</p>
<p>Connection to Google Tag Manager
You can link Google Tag Manager (GTM) to the website using a container ID:</p>
<p>In the main navigation, select Settings and then Website Settings,
in the Analytical Tools section, fill in the container ID.</p>
<p>You can find the container ID in the overview of your accounts, where all your containers are, including their IDs. Container ID format is GTM-XXXXXX.</p>
<p>Inserting Facebook Pixel
You can add Facebook pixel to your site using Google Tag Manager:</p>
<p>Open the container administration for the website to which you want to add the Facebook pixel,
select Add New Tag, and select Custom HTML as the tag type, 
enter the code for the Facebook pixel,
in the Tag Launch Options section, select Once per page and select All Pages as the launch rule,
in the last step you need to publish new settings in Google Tag Manager.  </p>
<p>The code for inserting the Facebook pixel via Google Tag Manager can be found on Facebook in the Event Manager. For more information go to Business Help Centre form Facebook.</p>
