<p>What is The Map Block?
Basic settings
Appearance</p>
<p>The Map Block allows you to clearly show the visitors to the website a specific location on a map.</p>
<p>Basic settings
You can enter the place you want to show on the map using an address or GPS coordinates. All it takes is to enter the beginning of an address and the auto-suggestion will show you the rest of the address.
There is an option to stretch the map across the width of the website.
Solidpixels use Google Maps for its maps due to its clarity and great functionality.
Appearance
In these settings, you can choose the appearance of the map. There are ten styles of colors and three different heights to pick from. Next, there are the settings of the default zoom and the option to turn on the controls of the map, which the visitors can use to move the map, or to keep map static.</p>
