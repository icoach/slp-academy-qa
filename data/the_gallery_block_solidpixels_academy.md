<p>Thanks to the Gallery Block, you can insert groups of images to your website and display them neatly in one gallery.</p>
<p>How to add a gallery
After putting the gallery block on the page, you can open the setting by clicking the block. The “Choose images” option will lead you to the gallery of files uploaded to the website, from which you can choose your images.
After adding the chosen images, you can edit each image by clicking the pen icon. You can adjust their description, alternative description or add a link, which will open when the visitors click the image. You can read more about how links work and where they can lead in this article. An image can be removed from the gallery by clicking the trash can icon.
Gallery appearance
In the gallery appearance settings you can choose from the three basic types of gallery. They are the Grid, Columns and Mosaic. Each one of these types can adequately adjust itself to the type of device the gallery is being viewed on.
Grid
If you choose the Grid option, images in the gallery will appear regularly with equal spacing. There are two options to choose from when it comes to the width of the images in the grid. The column width hides the sides of the original images and displays the images with the same aspect ratio. The aspect ratio settings can be found right underneath the width settings.</p>
<p>The original width will display the image in their original aspect ratio. In this case, you can choose the horizontal and vertical alignment in the gallery.</p>
<p>Columns
By choosing the Columns option, the images in the gallery will appear in regular columns, where the images have the same width, but their height stays true to the aspect ratio. Next, you can choose the number of displayed columns and the spacing between the images.</p>
<p>Mosaic
If you choose the Mosaic option, the image will appear in the gallery arranged according to the displayed tile pattern - first image will be large, the next two images are smaller and either the same width or height of the previous image. The images alternate following this pattern, and on every even row, the pattern is mirrored. Next, you can choose the orientation of the smaller images and their aspect ratio, number of tiles per row and the spacing between the images.</p>
<p>Independently of whether you choose the grid, columns or the mosaic, you can toggle the option to open images in lightbox - turn this function on, if you want the visitors of the page to be able to view the images individually in larger size. You can also set the width of the gallery to be stretched to the width of the website. If you choose either the grid or the columns, you can make the image description visible, or hide it. If you choose the mosaic option, the image description will appear automatically. Their vertical and horizontal alignment can be edited in the last section of the gallery settings. The changes are saved by clicking the “Save” button.</p>
<p>Advanced settings
In the advanced settings, the ID can be very useful to you. It is used to create a link using an anchor. You can learn more about setting up and using anchors in this article. Next, there is an option to Use source images. Toggle this option on, if you want the image to be uploaded without any resizing done according to the website’s responsiveness, which is otherwise automatic. Additional information about automatic generation of responsive images is in this article.</p>
