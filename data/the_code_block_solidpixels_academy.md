<p>The Code Block allows you to insert third party code to your website. Thanks to it, you can create for example calendars, tables, pop-up windows etc.
It can also serve for third party embedding, such as YouTube videos, Spotify podcasts and many more.
The code languages which can be inserted are HTML, JavaScript or CSS styles. It is therefore an element for more technically advanced users.
We are not responsible for the contents and functionality of the code and we cannot guarantee that it will work, since there is no way for us to control it - it is only up to you what will be added to the website using The Code Block.
However, for security reasons, certain JavaScript codes cannot be added to the website.</p>
<p>How to add code
After creating the block, click the middle of it. You can insert the code into the window which will appear.</p>
<p>Where will the code appear?
The code can be added either to the body of the page or to the footer.
If you insert the code into the body of the page, its effects will appear only on this specific page.
If you want the code to appear on every page of your website, we recommend you insert it into the footer, which is connected with all the pages.
Types of code
As mentioned before, you can insert HTML, JavaScript and CSS styles code.
The Code Block thus enables the insertion of retargeting and remarketing codes, verification codes for various services and the connection of chat services (so-called chatbots).
Alternative ways of inserting code
If it’s not possible to insert the code directly to the website, we recommend using Google Tag Manager, which offers more ways to insert code and has better settings. More about setting up Google Tag Manager can be found in this article.</p>
