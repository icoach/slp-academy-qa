List of events</p>
<p>Schedule and present events on your site that only appear at a time you set. A clear list of all events will help you to create events easily and clearly. Creating the details of the events themselves then works the same as creating static pages, ie using the drag &amp; drop editor.
Using events
You can access the list of events through the control panel via the "Modules" tab. In the drop-down menu under the "Events" module, you then have access to all databases related to events.
Creating and setting up events
Events are created the same way as for previous databases, ie using the "New record" button. When creating an event, only its name and date of the event are needed. All other information is adjusted in the event settings.
After clicking on one of the records, the detail of the event will open. This detail behaves like a normal web page and it is possible to insert content into it the usual way, ie using the drag &amp; drop editor.
Event settings can be opened using the gear wheel in the upper left corner of the detail. In the settings, you can edit, for example, the name of the event, the date and address of the event, the link for registration and much more. There is also a tab for setting up the SEO of the event.
Also important is the image of the event, which you can find at the very bottom of the settings. This image will be displayed on the list of events.</p>
<p>List of events
Thanks to the previous steps, you should already have events ready. However, these events are still hidden in the database and it is necessary to present them on the website.
You can link to individual events using URLs directly within the text or other content of the site. However, using the List block is a much simpler and more visually friendly way.
A List is a content block that you can insert anywhere on the website. Within the list is the data source settings - in our case we will use events. The List offers a wide range of functions, which you can learn more about in the article on the List block.
The great advantage of thelist is the visually pleasing form. Events will also be listed with a name, date and image. In addition, the list offers many options of limiting the listed data.
In one section you can inform about upcoming events and list them all, while in the next section you can mention past events and create a list containing only past events. You can use tags to limit the list to only seminars or workshops, for example. You also have the option to hide specific events that you do not want on the statement.
In addition, the list also contains filters, thanks to which visitors can choose which events to list themselves.</p>
<p>Tabs in the settings such as Registration and Speeches are intended for more advanced programming work.</p>
