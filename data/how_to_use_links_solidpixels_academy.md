<p>Tip: Not every link is the same.  This article discusses the link feature, not the Links block. You can learn more about the Links block in this article.
The link feature allows you to add any link to selected blocks on your site. Thanks to it, website visitors have the opportunity to access different pages, external URLs, files you have uploaded, or you can directly link to your e-mail or phone number.
Where can the links lead to
You always have five possible targets for your link. When you link to a page, you take visitors to any other page within your site. You can also create an anchor this way. Anchors will scroll down the page to a specific section.

<p>Another link destination can be an external URL. Through it, visitors get to another website. If you select e-mail as your destination, visitors will click on the link to have their e-mail client window open so that they can write a message to the address you link to. The phone option allows you to call the linked number after clicking. If you want to link to files that you do not want to be a part of the content, select the file option. You can then choose from all the files uploaded to the gallery.</p>
<p>Tip: When to set the link to open in a new window? For each link, you can set whether its content is loaded in a new window or not. For an external URL, opening in a new window makes sense because visitors are taken outside of your site, but your page will still be bookmarked in case they want to return. However, if you're linking to a page on your own site, it's more convenient for the visitor to stay in the same window.
Where can links be inserted
You can embed the link in multiple places on your site. A text (or part of it), an image, or a button can all act as a link. You can also link from an image in a gallery or slider.
How to add a link to text
In the text block highlight the part of the text that will act as a link. In the settings tab, select the symbol for inserting a link.</p>
<p>After inserting the link, the text changes color and becomes underlined. Once the changes are published, the link should work.
How to add a link to an image
After clicking on the desired image, the settings tab will be displayed. Click on "Link", which should have the status "inactive" for now. Set the content of your link and click "Done". Once the changes are published, the link should work.</p>
<p>How to add a link to a Button block
The function of the button block is to link. When you click on it, the settings tab will appear. Click on "Link", which should have the status "inactive" for now. Set the content of your link and click "Done". Once the changes are published, the link should work.</p>
<p>How to add links to images in galleries and sliders
If you want to add a link to an image that is part of a gallery or slider, click on the selected gallery or slider and select the specific image to which you want to attach a link in the settings tab. Use the pencil symbol to get to the image settings tab. Now click on "Link", which should now have the status "inactive". Set the content of your link and click "Done". Once the changes are published, the link should work.</p>
<p>How to delete a link
To delete a link, click the Link again in the settings tab of the selected block and select Delete. In the case of a link in text, select the highlighted part and select the symbol for deleting the link in the toolbar.</p>
<p>Tip: Smart internal links. The Solidpixels system uses so-called dynamic URLs. Once you create an internal link, it always remains functional. Even if the URL of the page you are linking to changes (for example, by changing the name of the page).</p>
