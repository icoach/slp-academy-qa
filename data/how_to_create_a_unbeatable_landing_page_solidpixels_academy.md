How to do it
5 principles to keep in mind</p>
<p>One of the biggest obstacles to communicating with today's internet user is their fragmented attention span. Important messages therefore need to be simplified as much as possible, clearly formulated and cleansed of all unnecessary stimuli. This is where a landing page can be of great help.
Today's companies use it not only when they want to introduce or sell a product or service, but also when they want to draw attention to a planned event, present an important case study, communicate a special offer or attract participants to a webinar. There are many ways to use it and there are no limits to your imagination when creating it. However, in order for a landing page (or landing page) to successfully serve its purpose, it is necessary not to underestimate a few basic rules when creating it. You can read more about what a landing page is here.
Why isn't the page on the main site enough?
Let's start by answering the question that probably came to your mind at the beginning of this article. Why do I need to create a separate landing page when I can use a page on my existing basic website for the message? Technically, you can create a landing page within the main site and then hide the navigation and footer of the site. However, an externally visible "frontend" separation of the landing page from the corporate website for its visitors makes sense. We create a landing page when we want to structure our communication. It is used when we need to send a specific, narrowly focused message with a clearly defined goal towards a specific target group that we do not want to distract with the rest of our communication, which serves completely different purposes.
If a company's basic website were to serve all of the company's communication objectives, it would become a disjointed and cluttered place that would cease to serve its purpose. By having different types of landing pages, a company can maintain the scope and tonality of its communication on the main site, but at the same time tailor the communication to short-term goals, such as a time-limited offer, registering for a webinar, or finding a potential future team member.
So what is the purpose of a landing page?</p>
<p>You want to introduce a new product or service.
You want to sell an existing product or service (especially through an online campaign).
You want to start a long-term communication with potential customers (to get them to subscribe to a newsletter).
You want to reach a new target group (or use a different tone of communication to reach an audience you don't normally communicate with - for example, you can use this to attract potential job applicants to your company).</p>

How to do it
The process of creating a landing page is somewhat the same as creating any other website, but it has its own specifics.</p>
<p>Defining the goal. A landing page is often created hand in hand with an online marketing campaign. The planned campaign has one specific goal that it can try to achieve through the landing page. In general - the more specific the goal, the better.</p>
<p>Plan structure, content and design. Nothing new under the sun. But remember that a landing page should properly be just one simple page leading to a clear goal. So the space to showcase your offer is very limited. Communicate all the essentials, but be concise. The landing page will deservedly reward you with a good conversion rate.
     </p>
<p>Content creation. Here comes the very essential part of creating your landing page. Invest in creating quality content that presents well exactly what you want to convey to your visitors.
     </p>
<p>Implementation. When you have all the groundwork in place, you can move on to the actual implementation. Which parts of the landing page should you focus on first?</p>
<p>Introductory section
The introduction is what captures the visitor's attention and compels them to read on. Its appearance should be tailored to your brand awareness. If your brand is well-known, you can offer the landing page visitor the main action (buy button, form, etc.) right in the introduction. If you have yet to introduce yourself and your product, encourage visitors to keep scrolling.</p>
<p>Features and Benefits
Present your benefits simply and clearly. Your potential customers will appreciate it. Try to focus on the actual benefit to the customer instead of the technical details - talk about the benefits they will receive when they purchase your product or service.</p>
<p>Call to action
The call to action is the alpha and omega of the landing page. Take care of how it looks and where it will be located. It should, of course, be clearly named and sufficiently prominent.</p>
<p>Reference
Showcase your product or service through reviews from your satisfied customers. An independent view gives you credibility.</p>
<p>Forms
Is the goal of your landing page to register or get information from visitors? Then a form is the ideal conversion element for you.</p>
<p>Contact
What if customers have additional questions or want to check your Facebook or Instagram? Include a contacts section at the end. Even new followers can be your micro-conversion.</p>
<p>Preparation for measurement. In order to monitor the performance of your landing page and continuously optimize it, you need to connect it to selected analytical tools and start collecting relevant data. One of the most common conversion elements of a landing page is the form. Learn how to measure form conversion in this article.</p>
<p>Connecting with marketing tools. Think about where you can bring visitors to the landing page from. In addition to online campaigns, you can try newsletters, social media posts, QR codes in print ads, etc.</p>
<p>Optimization and constant tweaking. Remember that a landing page is a living organism that needs your constant care. Monitor the data you collect regularly and try to renew the landing page (you can try A/B testing for effective comparison of results). Even a minor tweak can affect the performance of your page.</p>
<p>5 principles to keep in mind
Now that you have the process of creating a landing page down pat, here are five rules to keep in mind throughout the process:</p>
<p>Do not distract.
    A landing page exists for one purpose only. Strip it of any subpages, unnecessary photos or texts and focus on how to lead the visitor to the best possible destination.
Remove excess links.
    Don't link to your main site (or any other site). Give your visitors all the information they need so you don't have to send them elsewhere to get it. Your landing page should be all they need to take the desired action.
Don't try to reinvent the already invented.
    The problem you are solving has already been solved by a host of entrepreneurs before you. Don't try to challenge the competition by making your landing page fundamentally different; customers are used to established procedures and logical landing page layouts. Take inspiration from the market leaders in your segment. They know what they're doing.
Speak to the point.
    Don't talk about anything other than what you're showing. Use photos that match the text and vice versa. A picture may be worth a thousand words, but if it adds zero value, there's no point in using it.
Don't add additional target actions.
    Those who want too much, have nothing. Don't try to get the most out of your landing page by including additional conversion elements that are unrelated to the main goal of the page. They can reduce the conversion rate of the main action.</p>
